# Comment to GitHub

> Convert blog comments to GitHub PRs

A small docker container that takes comments from a blog, offers a check
with reCaptcha and posts them as PR on a GitHub project.


## Maintainers

* [@penguineer](https://github.com/penguineer)


## Contributing

PRs are welcome!

If possible, please stick to the following guidelines:

* Keep PRs reasonably small and their scope limited to a feature or module within the code.
* If a large change is planned, it is best to open a feature request issue first, then link subsequent PRs to this
  issue, so that the PRs move the code towards the intended feature.
